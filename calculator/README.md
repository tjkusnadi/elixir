### Calculator

Basic calculator function such as addition, substraction, multiplication, division.

I'm using elixir 1.15.4

To run it make sure elixir is installed on your system

```chmod +x calculator.exs``` to make it executable.

`usage ./calculator.exs [operation] [x] [y]`

Example
```bash
./calculator.exs divide 4 2
```
```The result of dividing 4 by 2 is 2.0```
