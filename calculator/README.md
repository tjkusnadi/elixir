### Calculator

Basic calculator function such as addition, substraction, multiplication, division.

I'm using elixir 1.15.4

To run it make sure elixir is installed on your system

```chmod +x calculator.exs``` to make it executable.

`usage ./calculator.exs [operation] [x] [y]`

Example
```bash
./calculator.exs add 1 8
The result of add 1 8 is 9

./calculator.exs substract 101 100
The result of subtracting 100 from 101 is 1

./calculator.exs multiply 102 2
The result of multiplying 102 and 2 is 204

./calculator.exs divide 4 2
The result of dividing 4 by 2 is 2.0

```
